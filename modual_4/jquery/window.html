			Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the
			device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you and
			Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a business, where your principal place of business
			is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is the device
			manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer if
			you acquired the software directly from Microsoft. Note that if you are a volume license customer, use of
			this software is subject to your volume license agreement rather than this agreement.
			This agreement describes your rights and the conditions upon which you may use the Windows software. You
			should review the entire agreement, including any supplemental license terms that accompany the software and
			any linked terms, because all of the terms are important and together create this agreement that applies to
			you. You can review linked terms by pasting the (aka.ms/) link into a browser window.
			By accepting this agreement or using the software, you agree to all of these terms, and consent to the
			transmission of certain information during activation and during your use of the software as per the privacy
			statement described in Section 3. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the
			software or its features. You may contact the device manufacturer or installer, or your retailer if you
			purchased the software directly, to determine its return policy and return the software or device for a
			refund or credit under that policy. You must comply with that policy, which might require you to return the
			software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a refund or credit, if any.
			1. Overview.
			a. Applicability. This agreement applies to the Windows software that is preinstalled on your device, or
			acquired from a retailer and installed by you, the media on which you received the software (if any), any
			fonts, icons, images or sound files included with the software, and also any Microsoft updates, upgrades,
			supplements or services for the software, unless other terms come with them. It also applies to Windows apps
			developed by Microsoft that provide functionality such as mail, contacts, music and photos that are included
			with and are a part of Windows. If this agreement contains terms regarding a feature or service not
			available on your device, then those terms do not apply.
			b. Additional terms. Additional Microsoft and third-party terms may apply to your use of certain features,
			services and apps, depending on your device’s capabilities, how it is configured, and how you use it. Please
			be sure to read them.
			(i) Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those services
			is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services Agreement at
			(aka.ms/msa). You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service terms of use or the app’s
			settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.
			(ii) Microsoft, the device manufacturer or installer may include additional apps, which will be subject to
			separate license terms and privacy policies.
			(iii) The software includes Adobe Flash Player that is licensed under terms from Adobe Systems Incorporated
